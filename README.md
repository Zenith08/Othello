# Othello
![Game Setup](/docs/othello-start.png)
This game has been called many different names, but the one I grew up with was *Othello*. The game revolves around trapping your opponent's pieces between two of your own to claim those pieces.
This rendition of the game uses the Processing library for Java and features
- Score display
- Allowed moves
- AI for both black and white

This means the game can be changed to play however you like, with a friend, or individually.
